1) Detect a crash and get a UNIX epoch timestamp of the crash (shown
   in gdb by default).

1501638297

2) Select all the lines from the fuzzer's output log that have that
   timestamp.

log1.txt

3) Determine all the session UUIDs that are listed on those lines.

I ran the following:
$ cat log1.txt | cut -d ':' -f2 | egrep -v ']|Reconnecting|Connection|Stop|^$' | sort | uniq
0b80189c-e30c-49b4-9be3-5596807f2848
453b74eb-17d0-4c04-876d-4fd1df9b4fb2
4d40b0af-e7cd-4bbe-9753-7ed95259693d
4dc7ac76-4cc8-4c6b-86b0-7807ffc30565
5ab22134-611d-4447-8d4d-e386787bbbf5
5c1119d9-2142-4798-b0b0-308d8e25e0de
92a8ca7a-dedf-41de-be22-8da22bfec88c
bdb0c841-021e-4ca0-9347-4f3453ad5232
dfbb35d7-cc11-48be-8bfc-c9baaf540d43

4) Extract all the lines from the fuzzer's output log that have one of
   these UUIDs (those sessions may start or end before and after the
   timestamp).

All the sessions of the specified UUIDs only appeared at the UNIX epoc time.

5) Now you have all the control messages that were sent, and their
   ordering.
